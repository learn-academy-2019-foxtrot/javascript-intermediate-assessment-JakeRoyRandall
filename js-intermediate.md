# ASSESSMENT 3: INTERMEDIATE JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What are the HTTP verbs? Which CRUD action corresponds to each verb?

  Your answer:

      GET -> READ
      POST -> CREATE
      PUT -> UPDATE

2. Why would you use object destructuring?

  Your answer:
    Anytime you need to call a property of an object multiple times it's a good idea to restructure to ensure you can be maximally lazy

  Researched answer:

    What does destructuring mean? It’s a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, maps and sets — which we’re going to learn more about in a future ES6.io video —into their own variable. It allows us to extract properties from an object or items from an array, multiple at a time.

3. Why is testing important?

  Your answer:
    To ensure that you are getting the outputs you expected. To ensure that you have taken into account all potential inputs.

  Researched answer:

    Software testing is very important because of the following reasons: Software testing is really required to point out the defects and errors that were made during the development phases. Example: Programmers may make a mistake during the implementation of the software.

4. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:
    A class defines a constructor that has attributes and is a blueprint for future objects..

  Researched answer:

    A CLASS is simply a blueprint of an object which we are going to create. So it contains properties and methods that an object is going to have. Now OBJECT is simply an instance of the class.

5. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

  Your answer: I really solidified my understanding of many of the concepts by helping my team understand the concepts. I believe Richard Feynman said something to the effect of: you don't really know something, until you can teach it, and it wholeheartedly agree.



### HTML/CSS Review questions: First, try to answer each question on your own then Google the answer to further your knowledge.

1. How do you link a CSS file to your HTML page?

  Your answer:

    inside a <link> tag with type stylesheet.

  Researched answer:

    You can link this external file (. css file) to your HTML document file using the < link > tag . You can place this < link > tag Within the < head > section, and after the < title > element of your HTML file. The value of the rel attribute must be style sheet.

2. What is the difference between a div and a span?

  Your answer:
    div is a block level element and span is not.

  Researched answer:

    The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

  Your answer:
    Use id when you are giving an individual element a styling and will not need to create another element of the same type, requiring the same stying in the future (e.g. the gameboard in our games).

    Use a class when you are giving a several elements a styling and/or will need to create another element of the same type, requiring the same stying in the future (e.g. the squares in our games).

  Researched answer:

    The class selector uses the HTML class attribute, and is defined with a "." id is used when we have to apply CSS property to one attribute only. class is used when we have to use CSS property in many locations within the same page or different.
